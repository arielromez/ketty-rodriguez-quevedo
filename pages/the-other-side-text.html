                                Painting this series is an insistence on looking
                                to the other side, the side of mystery, the
                                unknown. For years, I identified with darkness;
                                I painted it and believed it held what was most
                                interesting and profound. The dramatic, the
                                ugly, the self-destructive… all seemed to have
                                more weight than anything colorful or happy. I
                                thought that darkness was who I was, and
                                expressing it became almost a therapy; though
                                by focusing on it,

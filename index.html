                        How to be the tiger? Free.
                        <br>
                        How to feel all my potential in an instant?
                        <br>
                        How to feel the roar and how to let it out?
                        <br>
                        I can see the longing to run wildly,
                        fast as never before, holding nothing back for later…
                        
                        a movement like fire,
                        
                        that devastates everything known, 
                        
                        that leaves behind only the burning
                
                        and the dull scream
                        that shakes everything and eliminates
                        any trace of falsehood.
                        <br> 
                        Like that, to run and scream at the same time: like a shake-up of nature, like a hurricane, a tornado, a lightning bolt, a night of absolute tempest.
                        <br><br>
                        Tired of being in the shadow, controlled, fearful, worried about wasting energy, in case something changes in the future, in case it wasn't what I thought, because of others, because of commitments, in case at some point it isn't worth it.
                        <br> 
                        How is it that I am the man and the woman? The strength and the delicacy?
                        The killer and also the victim of everyone?
                        <br> 
                        How do I make peace with both?
                        I am guilty of almost everything one can be and I am already raining.
                        <br> 
                        How to be free?
                        <br> 
                        How to be without fear?
                        <br> 
                        Without wanting to be different?
                        <br> 
                        Without wanting to feel different?
